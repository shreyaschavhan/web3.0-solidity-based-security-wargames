> - In a competition, organizers propose a challenge and invite people to participate. 
> - During the competition, the organizers determine the best participant according to some organizer-specified criteria. 
> - Participants often receive a score from which observers might infer that one participant is better than another, but not necessarily why. 
> - At the competition‚Äôs end, the organizers crown a victor, perhaps also awarding a prize

> - Military exercises play a critical role in preparing forces to perform their assigned missions. 
> - Typically, a military unit will participate in exercises of increasing complexity as it prepares for deployment. 
> - Exercises also serve as intermediate evaluation opportunities for units after various training phases.
> - Additionally, exercise organizers often precisely dictate the prerequisite training. 
> - Most exercises try to immerse the unit in a realworld scenario similar to one the unit is expected to encounter while deployed. 
> - The military operates under the premise that if you train like you expect to fight, your fighting will mirror your training. 
> - So, the more realistic the training is, the greater likelihood of success in any real-world engagement.
> - Another fundamental feature of each exercise is the detailed feedback units receive regarding their performance. 
> - Deficiencies are noted, and units are expected to address them before future exercises or final deployment. 
> - The military supports entire organizations dedicated to crafting scenarios, hosting exercises, collecting performance data, and evaluating participating units.

> - A key difference between competitions and exercises is that exercise organizers play a critical role, both before and after the exercise, in preparing participants and helping them address deficiencies.

> - Web 1.0 refers to the earliest iteration of the World Wide Web. 
> - Web 1.0 included websites serving static content.
> - Web 1.0 can be considered a `read-only version of the web`, where the content of a website was served from a static file system rather than databases.

- ùëæùíÜùíÉ 2.0
> - Web 2.0 has been all about interactivity of users with the web.
> - Web 2.0 was more user-oriented, users started creating content themselves with the introduction of platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, and the internet space become more collaborative and social.
> - With Web 2.0, the web was no longer read-only, it become `read- and write-accessible` to users.

> - Data from the users is the key entity of this new web, leading to its exploitation. 
> - The `centralization` of web and user data by the internet giants is where users have made compromises to access these platforms.
> - As access to user data became a powerful asset for companies, data breaches began to occur. 
> - Applications built over Web 2.0 often experience data breaches and data leaks of user's data, which can sometimes include very sensitive data such as card credentials, passwords, etc.

- ùëæùíÜùíÉ 3.0
> - Web 3.0 is the next iteration of the web.
> - Web 3.0 could be considered a rethink of Web2.0 with `decentralization` as its foundation.
