> - In a competition, organizers propose a challenge and invite people to participate. 
> - During the competition, the organizers determine the best participant according to some organizer-specified criteria. 
> - Participants often receive a score from which observers might infer that one participant is better than another, but not necessarily why. 
> - At the competition’s end, the organizers crown a victor, perhaps also awarding a prize

- 𝑴𝒊𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒂𝒓𝒚 𝑬𝒙𝒆𝒓𝒄𝒊𝒔𝒆

> - Military exercises play a critical role in preparing forces to perform their assigned missions. 
> - Typically, a military unit will participate in exercises of increasing complexity as it prepares for deployment. 
> - Exercises also serve as intermediate evaluation opportunities for units after various training phases.
> - Additionally, exercise organizers often precisely dictate the prerequisite training. 
> - Most exercises try to immerse the unit in a realworld scenario similar to one the unit is expected to encounter while deployed. 
> - The military operates under the premise that if you train like you expect to fight, your fighting will mirror your training. 
> - So, the more realistic the training is, the greater likelihood of success in any real-world engagement.
> - Another fundamental feature of each exercise is the detailed feedback units receive regarding their performance. 
> - Deficiencies are noted, and units are expected to address them before future exercises or final deployment. 
> - The military supports entire organizations dedicated to crafting scenarios, hosting exercises, collecting performance data, and evaluating participating units.

- 𝑲𝒆𝒚 𝑫𝒊𝒇𝒇𝒆𝒓𝒆𝒏𝒄𝒆

> - A key difference between competitions and exercises is that exercise organizers play a critical role, both before and after the exercise, in preparing participants and helping them address deficiencies.

### 𝑾𝒆𝒃 1.0, 𝑾𝒆𝒃 2.0 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑾𝒆𝒃 3.0

- 𝑾𝒆𝒃 1.0
> - Web 1.0 refers to the earliest iteration of the World Wide Web. 
> - Web 1.0 included websites serving static content.
> - Web 1.0 can be considered a `read-only version of the web`, where the content of a website was served from a static file system rather than databases.

- 𝑾𝒆𝒃 2.0
> - Web 2.0 has been all about interactivity of users with the web.
> - Web 2.0 was more user-oriented, users started creating content themselves with the introduction of platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, and the internet space become more collaborative and social.
> - With Web 2.0, the web was no longer read-only, it become `read- and write-accessible` to users.

- 𝑺𝒆𝒄𝒖𝒓𝒊𝒕𝒚 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑷𝒓𝒊𝒗𝒂𝒄𝒚 𝑪𝒐𝒏𝒄𝒆𝒓𝒏𝒔 𝒊𝒏 𝑾𝒆𝒃 2.0
> - Data from the users is the key entity of this new web, leading to its exploitation. 
> - The `centralization` of web and user data by the internet giants is where users have made compromises to access these platforms.
> - As access to user data became a powerful asset for companies, data breaches began to occur. 
> - Applications built over Web 2.0 often experience data breaches and data leaks of user's data, which can sometimes include very sensitive data such as card credentials, passwords, etc.

- 𝑾𝒆𝒃 3.0
> - Web 3.0 is the next iteration of the web.
> - Web 3.0 could be considered a rethink of Web2.0 with `decentralization` as its foundation.

### 𝑾𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒊𝒔 𝒃𝒍𝒐𝒄𝒌𝒄𝒉𝒂𝒊𝒏?

> - Blockchain is a distributed ledger which means all the parties taking part in the transaction or the parties present on the blockchain has the copy of the ledger and there is no centralised database. 
> - In case of any failure of the centralized database it may lead to data loss but with blockchain this problem is solved. 
> - Another important advantage provided is the transparency of the transactions.
> -  Hyperledger fabric, corda, and `ethereum` are the major platforms for blockchain development.

### 𝑾𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒊𝒔 𝑬𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒓𝒆𝒖𝒎?

> - Ethereum is a project which is used to build the technology on which all transaction-based concepts can be built. 
> - It provides a system to end-developer for building software on formerly unexplored computer models in the mainstream. 
> - The key goal of this project is to facilitate transactions between individuals who would have no means to trust one another.
> - Ethereum is a transaction based state machine. 
> - It begins with a genesis state and incrementally execute a transaction to modify it into a final state. 
> - The state can contain various data as, balances, data pertaining, etc. 
> - There can be valid or invalid state changes. 
> - Invalid state changes can be due to invalid account balance modifications i.e. increase in receiver’s account balance without simultaneous reduction in the sender’s account balance.
> - Many transactions are combined in a block using Merkel tree and blocks are chained together using the cryptographic hash.
> - Blocks function as a journal, recording a series of transactions together with previous block and identifier for final state.

### 𝑪𝒖𝒓𝒓𝒆𝒏𝒄𝒚 𝒊𝒏 𝑬𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒓𝒆𝒖𝒎

> - Ethereum has an intrinsic currency called "Ether" or ETH, smallest sub-denomination of Ether is Wei.

### 𝑨𝒄𝒄𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒕 𝒊𝒏 𝑬𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒓𝒆𝒖𝒎

> - In Ethereum, state is made up of objects called as Accounts.
> - Each account has 20-bytes address. 
> - State-transition is transfer of value and information. Each account consist of four fields:
>   - 1) Nonce- Counter used to make sure that transaction is processed once
>   - 2) Ether balance
>   - 3) Contract Code
>   - 4) Storage
> - There are two types of accounts in ethereum:
>   - Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), which are controlled by private keys.
>   -  Contract Accounts, which are controlled by their contract code and can only be activated by an EOA.

### 𝑾𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒊𝒔 𝑮𝒂𝒔 𝑷𝒓𝒊𝒄𝒆?

> - Gas price is a scalar value equal to the number of Wei to be paid per unit of gas for all computation costs incurred as a result of the execution of the transaction.

### 𝑾𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒊𝒔 𝑮𝒂𝒔 𝑳𝒊𝒎𝒊𝒕?

> - Every transaction has a specific amount of gas associated with it called as GasLimit. 
> - Gaslimit is the amount of gas which is implicitly purchased from the sender's account balance. 
> - We can refer gas limit as, the total amount of gas a sender is willing to purchase for the transaction to be executed.

###  𝑻𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒔𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝒊𝒏 𝑬𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒓𝒆𝒖𝒎

> - The term Transaction is used in Ethereum to refer to the signed data package that stores a message to be sent from an externally owned account.
> - Message call and account creation are the two types of transaction. 
> - Transactions contain the recipient of the message, a signature identifying the sender, the amount of ether and the data to send, as well as two values called Start (Gaslimit) and Gas price.

### 𝑻𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒔𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒄𝒆𝒔𝒔

> - Check if the transaction is well-formed (i.e. has the right number of values), the signature is valid, and the transaction nonce matches the nonce in the sender's account. If not, return an error.
> - Calculate the transaction fee as START GAS * GASPRICE and determine the sender’s address from the signature. Subtract the fee from the sender's account balance and increment the sender's nonce. If there is not enough balance to spend, return an error.
> - Initialize GAS = START GAS, and take off a certain quantity of gas per byte to pay for the bytes in the transaction.
> - Transfer the transaction value from the sender's account to the receiver’s account. If the receiving account does not yet exist, create it. If the receiving account is a contract type account, run the contract code either to complete the transaction or until the execution runs out of gas.
> - If the value transfer fails due to the sender’s low balance or due to unavailability of gas, revert all state changes except the payment of the fees, and add the fees to the miner's account.
> -  Otherwise, refund the fees for all remaining gas to the sender, and send the fees for gas consumed by the miner.

Feature | Technologies
---|---
Data Storage | `Swarm is a distributed storage platform and content distribution service, a native base layer service of the ethereum web 3.0 stack.` The primary objective of Swarm is to provide a decentralized and redundant store for ethereum's public record, in particular, to store and distribute dapp code and data as well as blockchain data.
Web Technology |  Web 3.0 is an internet where core services like DNS and digital identity are decentralized. `Ethereum is perfectly suited to serve as shared back-end to a decentralized and secure internet`. Ethereum uses Web 3.0 as a platform for a decentralized application (DApp)
Client/Node Implementation | `Ethereum clients` are used for sending and receiving data. Wallet or custom applications connect to a client for transactions, may be for sending or receiving ethers, deploying a contract, executing a contract, initiating mining, etc. `Ethereum has many client/ node implementation as go-ethereum, parity, cpp-ethereum, pyethapp, etc.` Smart Contracts in ethereum are implemented using languages like Solidity, Lisp, etc.

> - A fundamental problem in distributed computing and multi-agent systems is to achieve overall system reliability in the presence of a number of faulty processes. 
> - This often requires processes to agree on some data value that is needed during computation. 
> - The algorithm involved in such processes is Consensus algorithm. 
> - There are mainly 3 types of consensus algorithms:
>   - Proof of Work (PoW)
>   - Proof of Stake (PoS)
>   - Proof of Authority (PoA)

- 𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒐𝒇 𝒐𝒇 𝑾𝒐𝒓𝒌 (𝑷𝒐𝑾)
> - Mining is the process of dedicating efforts to strengthen the series of transactions in one block over other competitor blocks.
> - Any node on public blockchain can act as a miner. 
> - The only requirement is that it should support resource requirement for mining in PoW.
> - In Proof of Work (PoW), miner has to solve the puzzle for validating the new block to be added. 
> - The first miner who gets the solution publishes it to the network. 
> - The difficulty level of puzzle changes for different blocks. 
> - Hence, the amount of computations differs for different blocks.
> - Hashing function takes input data and converts to Hash value also known as the message digest which is unique.
> - The hash value cannot be used for recreating the original data. 
> - Hence, the hashes used in such case are called as One Way Hashes
> - PoW uses GHOST protocol and ETHash algorithm. But, PoW is environmentally unfriendly due to its high power consumption

- 𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒐𝒇 𝒐𝒇 𝑺𝒕𝒂𝒌𝒆 (𝑷𝒐𝑺)
> - This algorithm is similar to PoW, the only difference is that here there is no competition as in PoW. 
> - Here, the network itself chooses the node which would validate the transaction known as the validator (not a miner). 
> - If node selected as validator does not validate the transaction then network selects next validator and process goes on untill the transaction is validated by any node. 
> - PoS uses CASPER protocol. 

- 𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒐𝒇 𝒐𝒇 𝑨𝒖𝒕𝒉𝒐𝒓𝒊𝒕𝒚 (𝑷𝒐𝑨)
> - In this consensus algorithm, network allows for only those nodes which are authorized for validating the transaction.
> - The chain has to be signed off by the majority of authorities, in which case it becomes a part of the permanent record.
> -  This makes it easier to maintain a private chain and keep the block issuers accountable.
